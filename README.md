# Note taking, tracking applcation

This is a note taking MERN application where a user can save their notes and keep track on their productivity, based on the amount of notes the user makes and can access through authentication

**This is the front end portion of the application** 

This application utilizes a few libraries to make this process possible:
## react-ChartJS

 - A chart making library where you can display data in real time

## bcrypt 

 - A hashing library that uses an algorithm to safely encrypt the user's password

## gsap & gsap/react

 - A responsive animation library that can dynamically control almost any property on the page, and increase functionality of UX interaction

There were a few libraries that I didnt get the chance to use due to time constraint

## multer

 - an express library that converts files that enables the download of files through

## p5

 - an artistic library that utilizes the canvas for drawing and interaction
